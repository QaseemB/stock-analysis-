# Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

The **Stock Market Analysis Dashboard** is a web-based application that fetches and analyzes stock data from various sources, visualizes key metrics (such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages, Trading Volume, and MACD), and provides a detailed stock summary. It allows users to track stock performance over time, with interactive charts and analysis tools. The project uses a **Node.js backend** to fetch stock data, stores it in **MongoDB**, and leverages **Flask** for data analysis and visualization.

## Features

- **Stock Data Fetching**: Fetches historical stock data (up to 20 years) for multiple stock symbols using a Node.js backend.
- **Data Storage**: Data is stored and managed in **MongoDB**.
- **Data Analysis**: Python and **Flask** are used to analyze stock data, calculate technical indicators, and generate charts.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Dynamic visualizations of stock performance with:
  - Moving Averages (3-month, 6-month)
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Trading Volume
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- **Stock Summary**: Displays summary statistics such as:
  - Latest Open/Close prices
  - Monthly return
  - Moving averages for short-term and long-term trends
- **Responsive Dashboard**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Plotly.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Flask (for data processing and generating charts)
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB
- **Visualizations**: Plotly for interactive graphs, static images generated via Python/Flask (Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, MACD)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- MongoDB
- Python 3.x
- pip (for Python package management)
- Flask (Python web framework)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QaseemB/stock-market-analysis-dashboard.git
   cd stock-market-analysis-dashboard

2. **Install dependencies**:
    for frontend
     ```bash
     cd client
    npm install

    for backend
    ```bash
    cd Server
    npm install

3. setup python enviroment:
    ```bash
    install the necssary python libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. run the backend
    start the flask server (ensure MongoDb is running locally or through a cloud service):
    bash
    python app.py

5. run the frontend 
    in the client directory:
    bash
    npm start

    ## usage

    Once the application is running, navigate to <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
    Select a stock symbol from the dropdown to see its historical performance, including moving averages, Bollinger bands, and trading volume.
    View the interactive charts and read the stock summary to gain insights into the stockâ€™s current performance.

    ## Future Development
    Scalability: Extend the project to fetch and analyze data for hundreds of stocks over multiple decades.
    ETL Pipeline: Create more advanced ETL pipelines to handle larger datasets efficiently.
    Cloud Deployment: Deploy the application using cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure) for better performance and scalability.
    Automated Alerts: Implement features to send alerts when stocks reach certain thresholds (e.g., price, volume).
